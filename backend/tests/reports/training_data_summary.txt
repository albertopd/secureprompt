üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Data consistency is below 80%
   üîß URGENT: Run data normalization before model training

üéØ NEXT STEPS:
   1. Run data normalization tool
   2. Re-train custom models with normalized data
   3. Test performance improvements
   4. Update training pipeline for consistency
